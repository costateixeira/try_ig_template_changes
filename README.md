# Local Template tester

This script gets a FHIR IG template from a github repo / branch, and replaces your local cache. This is used to test the IG templates.

Windows: Uses Robocopy 

How this works: 
This replaces the entire files except package.json to fool the publisher into thinking the template hasn't been touched, so the publisher does not download a new version.

1. delete the temporary folder in the current folder
2. clone the repo/branch
3. reorganize files in the correct folder structure 
4. remove .git folder
5. renames the package in the cache to append _original at the end (is this a good idea?) 
6. moves the  downloaded content content into the package in cache
7. restores the package.cache from the original template folder 

This could be improved, it's just a first working prototype

To do:
* Fail gracefully
* Review the _Original renaming - what if there is already a _original?
